## Introduction

`anomaly.module.variables`

The Variables module provides a convenient area to store single, Streams powered values that are accessible throughout your application. Variables are a good way to store small bits of information that may need to change later. For instance, you can create a variable for the site's official logo. If it ever changes, it can be easily changed in the Variables module.

## Managing Variables

Variables can be easily managed through the `control panel`. To get started navigate to the Variables module and select **New Variable** in the upper right.

First, you need to pick the `Field Type` you would like to use for the variable.

Next fill out the variable name, slug and field type configuration. The **slug** value will be used when accessing the variable later with the plugin or repository.

Lastly, set the value of the variable by selecting **Set Value** next to the variable in the list of available variables.
