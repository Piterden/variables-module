## Introduction

`anomaly.module.variables`

The Variables module provides a convenient area to store single, Streams powered values that are accessible throughout your application. Variables are a good way to store small bits of information that may need to change later. For instance, you can create a variable for the site's official logo. If it ever changes, it can be easily changed in the Variables module.
